        <h3 class="header-hypothesis">Screener</h3>
        <p>
          In UserZoom testing, 10% of users dropped off on the start page citing a lack of NHS Number or confusion around if their contact details are shared with the NHS.
        </p>
        <p>
          On further pages, similar reasons were cited by users as reasons to drop out of the journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide users with screener questions <br />
          <strong>Then</strong> users will better understand the service requirements <br />
          <strong>Because</strong> users will be provided with specific information on each requirement
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide users with screener questions <br />
          <strong>Then</strong> users will understand the NHS number requirement better <br />
          <strong>Because</strong> users will be provided with specific information about how to find their NHS Number, and what it is used for
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide users with screener questions <br />
          <strong>Then</strong> users will understand the contact details requirement better <br />
          <strong>Because</strong> users will be provided with specific information about what types of details the NHS holds and interactions with which services will likely mean their details are saved
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-hypothesis">Confirm your details interstitial</h3>
        <p>
          In user labs and UserZoom testing, users were left confused at what they were being asked of at the "confirm your identity" page.
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't understand the following steps of the service nor why they were being asked to submit personal identifiable data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide an easy to read summary before the "your details" form <br />
          <strong>Then</strong> users will know what they will need to do to authenticate themselves for the service <br />
          <strong>Because</strong> the stages will be shown clearly to them before they start
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide an easy to read summary before the "your details" form <br />
          <strong>Then</strong> users will better understand why they are being asked for personal data <br />
          <strong>Because</strong> it will be clearer why that data is being used and what role it plays in verifying the user
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-hypothesis">Preference question interstitial</h3>
        <p>
          Users are required to remember many new details about the NHS and how their data is used, and undergo an authentication process, before they can set their preference.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If</strong> we provide users with a summary of how their data is used by the NHS and how the process works <br />
          <strong>Then</strong> users will be better placed to make an informed decision <br />
          <strong>Because</strong> the need to remember every detail relevant to the opt-out service will be reduced
