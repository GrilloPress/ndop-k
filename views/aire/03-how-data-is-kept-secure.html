                The NHS takes the responsibility for protecting your personally identifiable data very seriously. Information Governance (IG) across the NHS ensures your data is looked after in accordance with good practice and the law. If an organisation canâ€™t prove it will look after data to IG standards, their request for access will be rejected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those who have access to data must have appropriate training. They must also be approved by the organisation requesting access.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure your data is secure:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>technology is used to restrict access and encrypt data</li>
                <li>national IT systems are kept up-to-date and relevant</li>
                <li>audit trails record every instance that data is viewed or used</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Information from your records is important for providing your individual care and for improving health, care and services through research and planning e.g. for monitoring safety and developing new treatments.
              </p>
              <p>When using data for purposes beyond your individual care the different organisations that make up health and care services are making a pledge to:</p>
