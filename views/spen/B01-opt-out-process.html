                     The NHS takes the responsibility for protecting your personally identifiable data very seriously. Information Governance (IG) across the NHS ensures your data is looked after in accordance with good practice and the law.

                     If an organisation canâ€™t prove it will look after data to IG standards, their request for access will be rejected.

                    The NHS may share this personally identifiable information in two different ways. The first reason for sharing is for your own individual care. This allows healthcare professionals, like doctors and dentists, to see your important medical details.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second reason for sharing is to help the NHS research, plan and improve health and social care services for you and your family.

                  <p>

               If you opt-out of sharing your personally identifiable data, details like your name and address will no longer appear in data shared by the NHS. This will only happen if opt-outs apply to the data set being shared.

               Once an opt-out request is received, it can take up to 21 days before it can be applied to future data releases.
